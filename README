Vicom uses the [Ctrl X] and [Ctrl Y] keys to comment or uncomment lines of code in a program.
It does this by examining the filename entered on the command line. It automatically writes
suitable key maps to a small r/w buffer located in the .vimrc file. Allowing the same pair of
keys to perform the comment or uncomment function for different comment styles.
Vicom's purpose is to rapidly comment out or restore blocks of source code whilst testing and
debugging. Used with the Vimake package it turns Vim in to a powerful programmers workbench.
Vicom once installed runs as an alias to both Vim and Gvim. So if you normally start a Vim
session such as:
        vi newprog.cc   or gvim newprog.cpp
Vicom first examines the command line and determines that the comment and uncomment maps should
be for a cpp program. It then writes these maps to a small buffer then passes control on to Vim
to perform its normal loading of the file. Now when you press <Ctl+X> or <Ctl+Y> the correct
comments occur in your program. If you load a file type that Vicom does not recognize the keymap
buffer is cleared.
Vicom recognizes the following file types. Gnu gcc,g++,Nasm,AT&T(gas)as,ruby,perl,python and bash.
